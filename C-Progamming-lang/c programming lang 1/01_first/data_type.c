    // What is data type ?
    // Those functions which tells us the type of data stored in a memory is called data type.It also specify that how much space a single data type is occupying like " char " is a data type which stores special characters in single cots and the sufficient space it takes is 1bytes

    int age=18; //Here "int" as a data type is telling us that the store value in named variable "age" is 18 which is integer  
    char hashtag='#';// Same " char " as a data type is displaying or showing that variable named  " hashtag" stores the special character "#" in meomory storage
    float pie=3.14;

    // NEXT TOPIC 
    // "CONSTANT" - CONSTANT are the stored values which that are fixed and cannot be change.
    // Their are three types of constant 
    // 1- integer constant - eg- 1,2,3,4,5,-6,-200etc
    // 2- real constant - eg- thoda bhut decimal type , 1.0, 2.0 , 3.14 , -2.4
