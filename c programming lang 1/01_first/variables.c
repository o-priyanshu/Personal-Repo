#include<stdio.h> // studio.h is a header file.In C programming language there are many types of header file these files are also known as "Library".
int main() //main is the entry point and caller which calls the functions.
{
    int number = 15; // int represents integers, while number is variable and 15 is stored value/value
    int age=18; //same for age 
    float pie=3.14; // float is used to represent decimal numbers.In this case,its a value of pie.
    char star='*';// char is used characters like * ( search character)
    return 0;// return is a function call which returns the values of fuctions to the caller.


    //THESE ARE THE RULES OF VARIABLES
    
    // 1 - CASE SENSITIVE - Its means upper case and lower case are both different.

    int a =7;
    int A=7; 

    // These both are different variables

    // 2 - ONLY ALPHABETS AND UNDER SCORE IS ALLOWED i.e "_"

    int _age=6; // vaild
    // int 9age=7 not valid

    // 3 - NO SPACE AND COMMAS BTW VARIABLE NAME

    // int my age =18; invalid bcz there is space btw my age 
    int my_age=18; // vaild bcz only one special character is allowed that is under score
